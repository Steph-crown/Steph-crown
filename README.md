## Hey, It's Stephen.

I am a **software engineer** with the keen instincts of _Sherlock Holmes_. I scrutinize the digital
landscape with the precision of a detective 🕵🏻. I craft intuitive user interfaces and solve complex challenges, approaching each
project as a captivating mystery to unravel. My mission is to create beautiful digital experiences that leave no enigma
unsolved.

I write articles, text-based courses, and build software applications.
